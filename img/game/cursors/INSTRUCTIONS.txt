Dimension Cursors
______________________________________


Dive into a deep, dark dimension, where you'll encounter intense angles and glassy gradients, 
and you'll wonder why you used that boring white arrow for so long.


To install:
1. After extracting the files, right click on the "Theme" file and select "Install."
2. If everything works fine, skip to step 5.
3. If it cannot find the files, click "Browse," and locate the folder that contains the cursor files.
4. Then click "Ok" and they will be installed to your Cursors folder.
5. To activate the cursors, go to "Mouse" in the Control Panel and click the "Pointers" tab.
6. Under "Scheme" select "Dimension," then click Ok and you should now be using the cursors.

If you have friends who might like these cursors, feel free to distribute them
on the condition that all of the original files are included and credit is given.
